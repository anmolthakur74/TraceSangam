**Reimagining agricultural export traceability using QR codes and blockchain.**

TraceSangam is a prototype solution that allows full traceability of agricultural produce — from the farmer to the final exporter. The system uses a mobile app for data capture, a backend for batch processing, QR codes for product tracking, and a dashboard to visualize the entire supply chain. A simulated blockchain ensures data integrity and trustworthiness.
